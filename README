INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DISTTER

Each implementation requires access to a posts.txt file to store and retrieve posts. The posts file must be stored in
the directory you are running Distter from.

To start Distter you simply run the Distter class.
You must give a username after the class call.
For Example: "java Distter MrBob" would start a Distter implementation with the username Mr. Bob.

If you are the first one to join you become the server, if someone else is already running Distter you simply become
their client, but then all interactions are the same.

Distter only recognizes certain inputs, all other inputs are simply ignored.

A hello message must be sent before Distter will recognize any of the other requests, type 'HELLO?' and Distter
will add the username and the version to the message. The user can then use all the following commands:

WHEN? (which has an automatice response of the time)

POSTS? <time> <headerCount> (additional headers are any which are not author, time etc. and they are labeled with '#')
#header                     (This has an automatic response of the options)
#header

FETCH? SHA-256 <post id> (To retrieve a particular post you use this command along with 'SHA-256 ' + the post's id)
                         (The post will automatically be saved to your text file)

GOODBYE! <optional> (You can then disconnect with an optional additional message)
